# Paula Nunez | Serial Founder & Intelligence Architect 🛠️

**Founder @ [W34P-Foundation](https://github.com/W34P-Foundation)** • **Founder @ AMY CERT** • **Founder @ The Ink Zombie**

I am a self-taught builder who thrives in the "messy" 0-to-1 phase. Whether I'm architecting deterministic intelligence protocols or standing up community emergency response systems, my focus is always on building high-utility infrastructure from the ground up.

### 🏛️ My Foundations
* **[W34P-Foundation](https://github.com/W34P-Foundation)**: A non-profit dedicated to open-source intelligence frameworks. Lead architect of the **XIQ (Extended Intelligence Quotient)** protocol.
* **AMY CERT**: Founded and led a Community Emergency Response Team, managing logistics, rapid response protocols, and community safety.
* **The Ink Zombie**: A custom print shop focused on the intersection of design, physical production, and entrepreneurship.

### 🧠 Technical Obsession: Abyssian-XIQ
Currently bridging the gap between stochastic LLM reasoning and deterministic execution. I build the "connective tissue" that allows AI agents to navigate complex product design environments with precision.

## ⚡ The Stats
* **Experience**: 6 years in high-growth startups (Employee #25 ➡️ 300).
